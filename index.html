                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            Kate and Brett met while working together in New York City sometime in 2013. Credit goes to their mutual friends Susie (Brett’s PM) and Anthony (Kate’s designer) for convincing Brett to interview for a job and eventually join Kate & Anthony.</br>
                            The rest was a rom-com worthy story of two people who everyone <i>else</i> knew would wind up together, but had to figure that out for themselves. A few months later, we finally realized what everyone else saw from the beginning-- now we invite you to celebrate our wedding!

                        <h3>Is it true the ceremony is standing room only?</h3>
                        <p>There will be limited seating, but it will also be a short one (~15minutes).</p>
                        </br>

                        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The attire is black tie optional. <br /> This means:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A long dress</li>
                                <li>A formal cocktail-length dress</li>
                                <li>A tuxedo or dressy suit</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h3>How do I get to Rochester?</h3>
                        <h4>Flying</h4>
                        <p>The hotel is a 15 minute drive from Rochester International Airport, which is served by all of the major airlines.</p>

                        <p>If you choose to fly, you probably don't need to rent a car as Uber and Lyft are all over Rochester, with a ride from the airport to the ceremony location costing under $20. The ceremony & reception are all conveniently located at a hotel, where you can stay with a 10% discount if you call and give our names. Everything we’re looking at for after parties is walking distance from the venue, so even if you choose to take a cab it will be a short trip and we’ve set up an event code with Lyft to give you $10 off each ride during the weekend!</p>

                        <h4>Driving</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you're driving to Rochester, The Inn on Broadway has complimentary valet parking available during the entire weekend.
                        </p>
